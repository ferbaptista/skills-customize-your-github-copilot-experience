## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Build the Hangman Game

#### Description
Create a command-line Hangman game where the program randomly chooses a secret word and the player guesses letters until they either reveal the whole word or run out of attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list
- Accept single-letter guesses and display current progress in the _ _ _ format (showing revealed letters and placeholders)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game with a clear win message when the word is fully guessed or a lose message when attempts are exhausted
- Be forgiving of repeated guesses (do not count the same incorrect letter multiple times) and handle invalid input gracefully

**Skills practiced:** String manipulation, loops, conditionals, random selection
